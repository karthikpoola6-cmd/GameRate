## Session Summary
Set up API credentials (Supabase + IGDB) and connected landing page to show real game data.

---

## Full Conversation Transcript

### User
Look at all provided materials and break down what you believe we are doing and what we have done. Starting from this session I want to create a session folder/file that stores our chats. At the end I will say end session and you will store this chat into a said file/folder in order for us to build off same exact session a different day.

### Assistant
Explored the codebase and provided a full project analysis:

**Project: SavePoint** - A "Letterboxd for video games" social platform

**What's Been Built:**
1. Core Infrastructure - Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript, Tailwind CSS with custom dark theme
2. IGDB API Integration (`src/lib/igdb/`) - Token management, search, get by ID/slug, popular/recent games
3. Landing Page (`src/app/page.tsx`) - Navigation, hero section, featured games grid, features section
4. Design System - Custom CSS variables, star rating component, game card component

**What's Not Done Yet:**
- User authentication pages
- Game detail pages
- Actual IGDB API connection on frontend
- User profiles, lists, reviews
- Database schema/tables

Created `.sessions/` folder and initial session file.

### User
I want this first session to contain entirety of this chat up until the point I explicitly say end session

### Assistant
Understood. When you say "end session", I'll update the session file with the complete transcript of our entire conversation.

---

### User
Last time you wanted supabase url and api along with IGDB info lets continue with that i will provide you the info

### Assistant
Asked for credentials:
- Supabase URL
- Supabase Anon Key
- Twitch Client ID (for IGDB)
- Twitch Client Secret (for IGDB)

---

### User
Supabase: url: https://keftzfvffnfgzkxughsd.supabase.co Publishible API Key: sb_publishable_UdKfFRalWdeM-XtzZgQpDQ_zX1YFUz9

### Assistant
Created `.env.local` with Supabase credentials. Asked for IGDB/Twitch credentials.

---

### User
how to set up? lead me slowly

### Assistant
Guided user through IGDB setup:

**Step 1:** Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console and log in with Twitch account.

---

### User
I have logged in

### Assistant
**Step 2:** Register a New Application
- Click "Applications" > "Register Your Application"
- Name: `SavePoint`
- OAuth Redirect URLs: `http://localhost:3000`
- Category: Website Integration
- Complete CAPTCHA and click Create

---

### User
I want to have a custom url eventually will this affect that? Is the client type confidential or public?

### Assistant
- **OAuth Redirect URL:** Won't affect custom domain. For IGDB we use Client Credentials flow (server-to-server) which doesn't use redirects.
- **Client Type:** Choose "Confidential" - for server-side apps where the secret stays on the server.

---

### User
user must have two factor auth enabled to perform this action

### Assistant
Guided user to enable 2FA:
1. Go to https://www.twitch.tv/settings/security
2. Scroll to "Two-Factor Authentication"
3. Click "Set Up Two-Factor Authentication"
4. Use phone SMS or authenticator app

---

### User
I dont see anything but when i try to recreate it says SavePoint already exists

### Assistant
Directed user to find existing app:
1. Go to https://dev.twitch.tv/console/apps
2. Look for "SavePoint" under "Your Applications"
3. Click "Manage"

---

### User
I dont see SavePoint listed under apps and no manage option. When i try to register app again, im getting this: client name already exists. Please try again

### Assistant
Suggested workarounds:
- **Option 1:** Hard refresh (Cmd + Shift + R) or log out/back in
- **Option 2:** Use different name like `SavePoint-dev`, `SavePointApp`, or `SavePoint1`

---

### User
It still isnt working is there a problem with URL?

### Assistant
Suggested different URL formats:
- `https://localhost`
- `http://localhost:3000/auth/callback`
- `https://example.com`

The redirect URL doesn't matter for IGDB - just a required field.

---

### User
is it website integration or application integration

### Assistant
Try **"Application Integration"** - more appropriate for an app that calls the IGDB API.

---

### User
it worked

### Assistant
Guided to get credentials:
1. Click "Manage" next to the app
2. Copy the **Client ID**
3. Click "New Secret" to generate Client Secret - copy immediately (only shown once)

---

### User
Client ID: ajc0udsuq2yyaw24bujmmw4kuyk8m4 Client secret: vtbs4iol34vzv7ghkhl56e7e61kozr

### Assistant
Updated `.env.local` with all credentials:
```
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=https://keftzfvffnfgzkxughsd.supabase.co
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=sb_publishable_UdKfFRalWdeM-XtzZgQpDQ_zX1YFUz9
TWITCH_CLIENT_ID=ajc0udsuq2yyaw24bujmmw4kuyk8m4
TWITCH_CLIENT_SECRET=vtbs4iol34vzv7ghkhl56e7e61kozr
```

Tested IGDB API - successfully fetched Zelda games. Setup complete!

### User
Lets review on what we have accomplished, explain what we have done right for example tell me that we built Landing page got apis and connected them. Then tell me next logical steps

### Assistant
**What We've Accomplished:**

1. **Project Foundation** - Next.js 16 + React 19 + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS
2. **Landing Page** - Navigation, hero, search bar UI, featured games grid, features section, CTA, footer
3. **Backend Integrations:**
   - Supabase - Client, server, middleware configured
   - IGDB API - Full client with searchGames, getGameById, getPopularGames, etc.
4. **This Session** - Set up .env.local, verified IGDB works, created session tracking

**Next Logical Steps:**
1. Connect Landing Page to IGDB - Replace placeholder data with real games
2. Build Game Detail Page - `/game/[slug]`
3. Wire Up Search - Real-time search functionality
4. Authentication - Login/signup with Supabase
5. Database & User Features - Tables, reviews, ratings, lists

---

### User
lets do step 1

### Assistant
Implemented Step 1 - Connected landing page to IGDB:

**Changes made:**

1. **`src/app/page.tsx`:**
   - Removed placeholder `featuredGames` array
   - Added imports: `Image`, `getPopularGames`, `getCoverUrl`, `IGDBGame`
   - Updated `StarRating` to convert IGDB 0-100 scale to 0-5 stars
   - Updated `GameCard` to use `IGDBGame` type with real cover art
   - Made `Home` component async, calls `getPopularGames(12)`
   - Links now use game slug (`/game/${game.slug}`)

2. **`next.config.ts`:**
   - Added `images.igdb.com` to allowed remote patterns for Next.js Image

Restarted dev server and tested - IGDB images confirmed in page output.

---

### User
Landing page looks amazing, before we execute, explain to me step 2

### Assistant
**Step 2: Game Detail Page**

**What we're building:** `/game/[slug]` page (e.g., `/game/elden-ring`)

**The page will show:**
- Large cover image / screenshots
- Game title, release year
- Summary/description
- Genres (RPG, Action, etc.)
- Platforms (PC, PS5, Xbox, etc.)
- Developer/Publisher info
- IGDB rating
- Links to official sites

**How it works:**
1. Create dynamic route at `src/app/game/[slug]/page.tsx`
2. Fetch game data server-side using `getGameBySlug(slug)`
3. Build the UI with hero section, info panel, description
4. Handle 404 for games not found

**Files to create:**
- `src/app/game/[slug]/page.tsx` (new)
- Optional: `src/app/game/[slug]/loading.tsx`

### User

Session saved.
