# Session 16 - February 8, 2026

## Summary
Landing page redesign with real app screenshots in swipeable phone mockup carousel, condensed feature section, bug fixes (list edit visibility), and UI polish (neon Add Game button, dead code cleanup).

## What Was Done

### 1. Landing Page — Screenshot Carousel
- Extracted 7 real app screenshots from conversation, saved to `public/screenshots/`
- Optimized to JPEG (52-144KB each), profile kept as full-res PNG per user request
- Built swipeable phone mockup carousel (`snap-x snap-mandatory`, `scrollbar-hide`)
- 4 phones: Profile, Game Details, Home Feed, Ranked Lists
- Phone frames: 240px wide, 40px border-radius, white/10 border, purple glow shadow
- Labels in Orbitron font below each phone
- Centered with `calc(50% - 120px)` padding so next phone peeks from the right

### 2. Landing Page — Condensed Features
- Replaced 4 large feature cards (with embedded mock UIs, ~170 lines) with compact 2x2 grid
- Each card: icon + title + one-line description in glass cards
- Features: Half-Star Ratings, Top 5 Favorites, Follow Friends, Lists & Reviews
- Staggered ScrollReveal animations (80ms intervals)

### 3. Landing Page — Section Reorder
- Added hero "Get Started" CTA button with FadeIn (900ms delay)
- Moved PWA instructions from position #2 to bottom of page
- Added final "Start Tracking Your Games" CTA at very bottom
- Removed duplicate Get Started button from PWA section

### 4. List Edit Bug Fix
- `ListViewClient.tsx` relied on client-side `getUser()` call to determine ownership
- Race condition: if async call was slow, Edit button never appeared
- Fix: Pass `isOwnerFromServer` prop from server component which already has auth info
- Removed client-side auth check, `useEffect` import, and `listOwnerId`/`gameCount` dead props

### 5. Neon Add Game Button
- Changed from solid purple (`bg-purple text-white px-4 py-2`) to neon outline
- Style: `text-purple-light border border-purple/30` with purple glow boxShadow
- Orbitron font, smaller padding (`px-3 py-1.5 text-sm`)

### 6. Dead Code Cleanup
- Ran codebase scan via Explore agent — codebase was clean
- Only removed leftovers from our own ListViewClient edit (unused imports/props)

## Files Changed
- `src/app/page.tsx` — landing page redesign (screenshots, condensed features, reordered sections)
- `src/components/ListViewClient.tsx` — isOwnerFromServer prop, dead code removal
- `src/app/list/[id]/page.tsx` — passes isOwnerFromServer, removed unused props
- `src/components/AddGameToList.tsx` — neon button style
- `public/screenshots/` — 7 app screenshot images (NEW)

## Commits
- `03b3b33` — Add hero CTA, fix list edit visibility, neon Add Game button, clean up dead code
- `3c02e3a` — Redesign landing page with real app screenshots and condensed features

## Key Decisions
- Used real screenshots instead of miniature mock UIs (mock approach failed after 5+ iterations)
- Screenshots use plain `<img>` tags, NOT Next.js `<Image>` — avoids Vercel image optimization costs
- Profile screenshot kept as full-res PNG (956KB) per user preference; others compressed to JPEG
- Swipeable carousel chosen over stacked phone sections to reduce vertical scrolling

## Pre-Hackathon Notes (Feb 10)
- App is feature-complete and deployed
- Biggest opportunity: link to public profile (`/user/kartastrophe`) from landing page so judges can explore without signing up
- Demo data is solid: 59 games rated, 5 favorites, 2 lists, reviews
- Consider short demo video/GIF for judges who won't create accounts
- Don't add new features — risk breaking what works
