# Session 013 - February 2, 2026

## Summary
Bug fixes, navigation improvements, landing page copy updates, splash screen experiment, and codebase cleanup.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Bug Fixes (High Priority)
- **Fixed broken `/members` link** in user not-found page → changed to `/players`
- **Fixed CreateListForm cancel button** → now uses `router.back()` instead of linking to `/`
- **Fixed BackButton fallback** → if no browser history, navigates to `/home` instead of exiting app

### 2. Navigation Updates
- **Swapped gear and profile pic position** in desktop nav (gear first, then profile pic)

### 3. Profile Page
- **Reduced top padding** from `pt-24` to `pt-20` for tighter layout
- Experimented with gradient backgrounds behind avatar (reverted - didn't render visibly)

### 4. Landing Page Copy Updates
- **PWA instructions:** Changed "Install GameRate" to "Add GameRate to your phone for the full app experience — no app store needed."
- **Android instructions:** Removed "Install" language, now uses "Add" throughout
- **Rewrote "Why I Built GameRate" section:**
  - Paragraph 1: Personal story about playing games with brother, tracking in notes app
  - Paragraph 2: College student, taught self React/databases/APIs, passion project
  - Paragraph 3: "GameRate is the app I always wanted. I hope you enjoy it too."

### 5. Splash Screen (Experimented, Reverted)
- Added inline HTML splash screen with 1 second display time
- Crystal logo + "GameRate" text centered on dark background
- Removed after testing - user decided against it

### 6. Codebase Scan
- Verified all components are in use
- Verified all API routes are in use
- Confirmed all external images use `unoptimized` prop (no Vercel image charges)
- Found unused CSS: `chart-3`, `chart-4`, `chart-5` colors (not removed)
- Console.error statements present but don't affect Vercel usage

## Discussed But Not Implemented

### Error Handling for Silent DB Failures
- ListViewClient, FavoriteGames, BackdropSelector have optimistic updates without rollback
- User decided to keep current implementation for speed/efficiency
- Can revisit if users report data issues

### Play Store Deployment
- Discussed Capacitor as best option for Android deployment
- Would add `android/` folder to existing project
- Doesn't affect PWA
- Can preview in Android emulator or physical device
- Requires Android Studio installation
- $25 one-time fee for Google Play

### iOS App Store
- Would require $99/year Apple Developer account
- Capacitor also supports iOS builds
