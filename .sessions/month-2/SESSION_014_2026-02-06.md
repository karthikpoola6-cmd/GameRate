# Session 014 - February 6, 2026

## Summary
Added animations to profile page including load-on-enter effects, breathing rating bars, and bouncing pixel art sprites as an animated backdrop.

---

## Changes Made

### 1. Profile Page Animations
- **FadeIn component** - New reusable component for load-on-enter animations with configurable delay, duration, distance, and direction
- **Staggered entrance** - Profile header elements animate in sequence (avatar → name/stats → follow button → favorites)
- **ScrollReveal for below-fold content** - Rating section, game cards, and nav links animate when scrolled into view

### 2. Rating Distribution Enhancements
- **Breathing animation** - Bars continuously pulse with a subtle wave effect while visible
- **Viewport-aware** - Animation pauses when scrolled out of view, resumes when back
- **Staggered timing** - 0.2s delay between bars creates flowing wave effect
- **3 second cycle** with 12% height oscillation

### 3. Floating Pixel Art Sprites
- **5 unique sprite designs** - Ghost, Robot, Alien, Blob, Crab pets
- **12 sprites** bouncing around profile header
- **6 color palette** - Purple, light purple, gold, pink, blue, green
- **Neon glow effect** with shadowBlur
- **Bounce physics** - Sprites bounce off all 4 borders
- **Avatar exclusion zone** - Circular collision detection keeps sprites away from profile picture
- **Responsive** - Exclusion zone adjusts for mobile (centered) vs desktop (left-aligned)
- **Z-index layering** - Sprites float over text but respect avatar boundary

### 4. Visual Styling
- **Darkened header background** - Changed to `#080510` for neon contrast
- **CSS keyframes** - Added `bar-breathe` animation to globals.css

## Commits Made
1. `2c4272e` - Add profile page animations and floating pixel sprites
2. `37717f0` - Fix TypeScript error in FloatingShapes useRef

## Technical Details

### New Components
- `src/components/FadeIn.tsx` - Load-on-enter animation wrapper
- `src/components/FloatingShapes.tsx` - Canvas-based pixel sprite animation

### Animation Approach Discussion
- **Glass effects** - Explored but reverted (invisible on dark backgrounds)
- **Scroll-triggered waves** - Tried for rating bars but was janky on mobile
- **Continuous breathing** - Final choice for smooth 60fps animation
- **Geometric shapes** - Started with circles/squares/triangles, evolved to pixel sprites

### Performance Considerations
- All animations are client-side only (no Vercel/Supabase impact)
- Canvas uses requestAnimationFrame for 60fps
- `willChange: transform` for GPU acceleration
- Sprites drawn programmatically (no image downloads)

---

## Files Modified This Session
- `src/app/globals.css` - Added bar-breathe keyframes
- `src/app/user/[username]/page.tsx` - Added FadeIn, ScrollReveal, FloatingShapes, darkened header
- `src/components/RatingDistribution.tsx` - Added breathing animation with viewport detection
- `src/components/FadeIn.tsx` - NEW
- `src/components/FloatingShapes.tsx` - NEW

---

## Explored But Changed Direction
- **Scroll-reactive rating bars** - Wave direction based on scroll up/down (too janky on mobile)
- **Geometric shapes** - Circles, squares, triangles with neon glow (replaced with pixel sprites)
- **Intense glow effects** - Toned down to not interfere with profile content

---

## Current State
- Profile page has polished entrance animations
- Rating bars breathe smoothly while visible
- Cute pixel pets bounce around header as ambient decoration
- All changes deployed to Vercel
- Safe point created: `return` command will revert to `safe-point-v2-flicker-fix`

---

## Next Session Ideas
- Add animations to other pages (game detail, lists, players)
- User-selectable sprite pets
- More sprite designs
- Animation toggle in settings
